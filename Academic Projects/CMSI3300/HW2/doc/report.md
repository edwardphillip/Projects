Bayesian Network Modeling:
2. If there is only one edge connecting a node to any other node, then the PC Structure Learning Algorithm may struggle to identify the edge direction. If there are multiple edges, since to be a DAG, it cannot have a cycle, the directions may be more obvious.

Decision Network Programming:
1.  1.1 The juice is worth the squeeze as the expected utility increase would be 20.779393798843557, which put in a dollar amount, is well over the $2 per-persion Facebook is charging.
    1.2 No, the juice is not worth the squeeze as the expected utility increase is 0, hence $0, which is below the price of $0.25.
2.  I do believe the practice of taking data and computing the best decisions is ethical in itself. I believe the unethical part of it is often how and where the data is retrieved and the transparency in how it is used. If the user provided their information to a social media site, I find the user is accountable for taking the risks of the platform knowing their name, birth date, etc. associated with that action. As for such things as the IP Address of the user(which is not intentionally provided by most users), I believe it should be blatantly announced their data will be used beforehand. Further on this, I believe it would be more ethical if how the user's data is being used was more readable as opposed to a 90-page terms of service document, which the user is forced to accept to continue. But, as summarizing such details is a difficult task, I deem this will be a difficult path to follow legally.
As for ads curated based on perceived group, I agree with my previous statement that is, it is ethical given the data was ethically gathered. Just because something is done on a larger scale or by a larger entity, it does not dissipate the wrongdoings or the blame of the individual.
