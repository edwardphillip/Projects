warmup.py

Skeleton for answering warmup questions related to the
AdAgent assignment. By the end of this section, you should
be familiar with:
- Importing, selecting, and manipulating data using Pandas
- Creating and Querying a Bayesian Network
- Using Samples from a Bayesian Network for Approximate Inference
