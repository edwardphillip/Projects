class SalaryPredictor:

    A Logistic Regression Classifier used to predict someone's salary (from LONG ago)
    based upon their demographic characteristics like education level, age, etc. This
    task is turned into a binary-classification task with two labels:
      y = 0: The individual made less than or equal to 50k
      y = 1: The individual made more than 50k
    
    [!] You are free to choose whatever attributes needed to implement the SalaryPredictor;

        Creates a new SalaryPredictor trained on the given features from the

        1. Preprocesses the training data
        2. Fits the Logistic Regression model to the transformed features
        3. Saves this model as an attribute for later use

        salary classification and converts them into the numerical features that
        can be used both during training and classification by the LR model.
        
        Parameters:
            features [pd.DataFrame]:
                The data frame containing all inputs to be preprocessed where the
                rows are 1 per person to classify and the columns are their attributes
                that may require preprocessing, e.g., one-hot encoding the categorical
                attributes like education.
            
            training [bool]:
                Whether or not this preprocessing call is happening during training
                (i.e., in the SalaryPredictor's constructor) or during testing (i.e.,
                in the SalaryPredictor's classify method). If set to True, all preprocessing
                attributes like imputers and OneHotEncoders must be fit before transforming
                any features to numerical representations. If set to False, should NOT fit
